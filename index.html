      <h2>Why This Truck Matters</h2>

      <p>The image shown is a picture of my truck before I stopped daily driving it. It is now parked to be my project truck that I work on on the weekends and breaks during school. This truck has been through it all with me and it’s going to get the revamp it deserves.</p>

      <p>A big reason I picked this image of my truck was because it means the world to me. It’s not just some beat up pickup to me — it was my first truck and my dream truck rolled into one.</p>

      <p>This is a picture of my truck when I had just got done working on it, and I thought it looked better than usual that day.</p>

      <h3>What I’ve Done So Far</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Took it apart and painted the axles</li>
        <li>Sandblasted and powdercoated the frame</li>
        <li>Bought a wood flatbed</li>
        <li>Got a diesel engine block that I need to build</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>What I Plan to Do</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Install a manual transmission</li>
        <li>Add smoke stacks in the bed</li>
        <li>Upgrade the suspension</li>
        <li>Upgrade the interior</li>
        <li>Make it fully mechanical (no CPU, ECM, or TCM)</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Timeline</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>I parked it permanently around last February. Since then, I’ve made solid progress with the time I’ve had available.</li>
        <li>I hope to have it running by the end of summer, even if it’s not roadworthy yet.</li>
