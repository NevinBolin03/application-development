    <p>The image shown is a picture of my truck before I stopped daily driving it. It is now parked to be my project truck that I work on on the weekends and breaks during school. This truck has through it all with me and it's going to get the revamp it deserves.</p>
    <p>A big reason I picked this image of my truck was because it means the world to me. It's not just some beat up pickup to me, it was my first truck and my dream truck rolled into one. I loved it when it was running good, and when it stopped it broke my heart.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>What I've already done to it is take it apart and paint the axles, sandblast and powdercoat the frame, buy a wood flatbed for it, and have a diesel engine block that I need to build.</li>
        <li>What I plan on doing to it is putting a manual transmission in it, putting smoke stacks in the bed, upgrade the suspension, upgrade the interior, and make it completely mechanical. Which means no CPU, ECM, or TCM</li>
      </ul>

      <ol>
        <li>How long its been, It was about last Febuary I parked it permenently and it took a piece of me when I did. But I'd say since parking it I have gotten to work on it prety quick for the alotted time I have been able to. </li>
        <li>I hope to have it done by this end of summer, at least running, maybe not road worthy yet. But no running no less. </li>
